To automate the 1Password SSO configuration with Google Cloud, you can use scripts to configure the necessary settings via APIs or command-line tools. Below is a general outline of the steps and an example script to help you get started:
Steps to Automate 1Password SSO Configuration with Google Cloud

    Deploy the 1Password SCIM Bridge on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
    Configure Google Identity for 1Password SSO
    Automate User and Group Provisioning with SCIM

Example Script

This example uses a shell script to automate the deployment of the 1Password SCIM Bridge on GCP and set up SSO configuration.
bash

#!/bin/bash

# Variables (replace with your actual values)
PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"
REGION="your-gcp-region"
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME="scim-bridge-sa"
SCIM_BRIDGE_IMAGE="1password/scim-bridge:latest"
GCP_SSO_APP_ID="your-google-sso-app-id"
GCP_SSO_APP_SECRET="your-google-sso-app-secret"
DOMAIN="your-domain.com"

# Authenticate with GCP
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID

# Create a service account for the SCIM Bridge
gcloud iam service-accounts create $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME --display-name "SCIM Bridge Service Account"

# Assign roles to the service account
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID --member="serviceAccount:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountUser"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID --member="serviceAccount:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role="roles/storage.admin"

# Deploy the SCIM Bridge on GCP
gcloud run deploy scim-bridge --image $SCIM_BRIDGE_IMAGE --region $REGION --service-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com --allow-unauthenticated

# Get the URL of the deployed SCIM Bridge
SCIM_BRIDGE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe scim-bridge --region $REGION --format 'value(status.url)')

# Configure Google Identity for 1Password SSO
# Here you would need to use Google Admin SDK or Google Workspace APIs to configure the SSO settings

# Example: Setting up SSO with Google Admin SDK (requires OAuth 2.0 credentials)
# For more details, refer to Google Admin SDK documentation

# Install required tools
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib

# Python script to configure SSO (example)
python <<EOF
import os
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user']
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = 'path/to/your-service-account-file.json'

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
        SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE, scopes=SCOPES)

service = build('admin', 'directory_v1', credentials=credentials)

# Example: Create a new user for SCIM Bridge
user_body = {
    "primaryEmail": "scim-bridge@$DOMAIN",
    "name": {
        "givenName": "SCIM",
        "familyName": "Bridge"
    },
    "password": "your-strong-password",
    "changePasswordAtNextLogin": False
}

service.users().insert(body=user_body).execute()
EOF

echo "SCIM Bridge deployed successfully at $SCIM_BRIDGE_URL"
echo "SSO configuration completed."

Notes

    Google Identity Configuration: The example script includes a placeholder for configuring Google Identity using the Google Admin SDK. You will need to provide OAuth 2.0 credentials and adjust the script according to your specific requirements.
    1Password SCIM Bridge: Ensure you have the correct image and deployment settings for the SCIM Bridge. Refer to the 1Password SCIM Bridge documentation for more details.

This script provides a basic framework for automating the 1Password SSO configuration with Google Cloud. You may need to customize it further based on your environment and specific requirements.
